    <h1>Basics of investing</h1>
    <h2>Understanding Stocks and Shares</h2>
    <p>
        The stock market refers to the collection of exchanges and platforms where buying and selling of stocks or shares of publicly traded companies takes place. It provides a mechanism for companies to raise capital by selling ownership stakes to investors and allows individuals and institutions to invest in these companies. The stock market plays a vital role in the economy by facilitating capital formation and providing opportunities for investors to participate in the growth and success of businesses.
    </p>
    <h3>Stocks: </h3>
    <p>
        Stocks represent ownership shares in a company. When investors purchase stocks, they become partial owners and have the potential to benefit from the company&rsquo;s profits and growth. Stocks are traded on stock exchanges and their prices can fluctuate based on supply and demand dynamics and various market factors.
    </p>
    <h3>Shares</h3>
    <p>
        The term "shares" is often used interchangeably with stocks. It refers to the units of ownership into which the company&rsquo;s capital is divided. Each share represents a fractional ownership interest in the company.
    </p>
    <h2>Risk and Return in Investing</h2>
    <h3>Risk: </h3>
    <p>
        All investments carry some degree of risk. Risk refers to the possibility of losing some or all of the invested capital. Different investments have varying levels of risk. Generally, higher-risk investments have the potential for higher returns, but they also come with a higher likelihood of losses.
    </p>
    <h3>Return: </h3>
    <p>
        Return is the financial gain or loss generated from an investment. It can be in the form of capital appreciation (increase in investment value) or income (such as dividends or interest). Investors assess the potential return of an investment in relation to the associated risks.
    </p>
    <h2>Setting Financial Goals</h2>
    <p>
        Setting clear financial goals is an important step in investing. Financial goals may include saving for retirement, funding education, buying a home, or achieving a specific level of wealth. When setting financial goals, consider factors such as time horizon, risk tolerance, and desired outcomes. This helps in determining the appropriate investment strategies and asset allocation that align with your goals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Investing is a personal and dynamic process, and it&rsquo;s important to understand the basics and consider individual circumstances when making investment decisions. It is recommended to seek guidance from a qualified financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific goals and risk tolerance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another way to set a clear goal is to know what you want to do and stick to it consistently. A way for you to do this is to write this template below and fill in the relevant details down in your notes app, or a notebook.
    </p>
    <p>
    <q>I  want to achieve relevant investing goal by accumulating specific amount by years required to meet goal
    To do this, I&rsquo;ll contribute measurable amount  each time frame to my type of accounts and manage my investments to achieve an annual attainable% rate of return</q>
