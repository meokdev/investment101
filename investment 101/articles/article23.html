    <h1>Evaluating Company Financials: Balance Sheet</h1>
    <h2>What is a balance sheet</h2>
    <p>
    The balance sheet presents a snapshot of a company&rsquo;s financial position at a specific point in time. Key components include assets, liabilities, and shareholders&rsquo; equity. Analysts analyze total assets and debt levels to assess a company&rsquo;s financial stability and leverage. A company&rsquo;s assets are the sum of the liabilities and shareholder&rsquo;s equity.
    </p>
    <p>First, let&rsquo;s define the key terms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Assets - Everything owned by the company</li>
        <li>Liabilites - Financial obligations or debts that a company owes to external parties</li>
        <li>Shareholder&rsquo;s equity - The company&rsquo;s value after deducting all liabilities from its assets. It&rsquo;s what remains for the shareholders once all debts are paid or settled.</li>
